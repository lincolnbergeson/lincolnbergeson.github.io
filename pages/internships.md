My Internships: Facebook, Qualtrics, ExxonMobil
===

After getting back from my LDS mission to Canada, I started a degree in Computer Science at BYU with the goal of becoming a software engineer. Finding a good job was at the top of my list of things I was anxious about. During the school year, I looked for part-time software development jobs, and internships during the summers. Here is the rough timeline of my various jobs as a university student:

- Oct 2016 - August 2017: Drupal developer, on-campus
- August 2017 - December 2017: Research assistant, on-campus
- January 2018 - May 2018: Software Engineer at Qualtrics, part-time
- May 2018 - August 2018: Information Technology Intern, ExxonMobil
- September 2018 - May 2019: Qualtrics again, part-time
- May 2019 - August 2019: Production Engineering Intern, Facebook
- September 2019 - December 2019: Qualtrics again?

This post is a deep dive on how I got each of these internships, what they were like, and whether or not I enjoyed them.

For the purposes of this post, I will skip over the first two on-campus jobs and go start to corporate experiences. Generally, I disliked working on-campus jobs because the pay was bad and the work was uninteresting.

Qualtrics

Qualtrics is a good company with established software engineering practices, high growth trajectory, and most importantly, it's a fifteen minute drive from my apartment in Provo. I applied in October 2018, waited a month, went through a couple of weeks of video interviews, and got an offer in November. Originally the offer was for $32 an hour, but they quickly retracted that and gave me $28/hr instead, saying that $32/hr was their standard pay only for seniors. A few months later, they raised my pay back to $32. Overall weird experience -- it seemed like the recruiter genuinely slipped up and told me the wrong number, but was constrained by management and had to rescind. I didn't mind too much because it was still much better than the $12/hr I was making as a research assistant.

That experience turned out to be reflective of Qualtrics as a whole: good intentions, some mistakes, suprisingly rigid management backbone.

The first few months at Qualtrics were very rough. There was a miscommunication and my manager didn't think I was starting until August 2018, so when I showed up in January 2018, like the recruiter told me, it was about 8 months earlier than they were expecting. On top of that, I was thrown into a system engineering team rather than a software-focused team. The senior engineers on that team were very busy with a months-long datacenter project (can't share too many details here) and thus I fell by the wayside. I learned a few things about provisioning bare metal, and got to travel to San Jose once to rack servers, but there were a lot of days of staring at my monitors in a general state of "what the hell am I supposed to be doing here".

Before I even accepted the initial Qualtrics offer, I had accepted an offer with ExxonMobil for an internship in Houston, Texas. I have family in Houston and wanted to "try out" living there without committing to anything.

Boy oh boy, everything I thought was bad about Qualtrics was a million times worse at ExxonMobil. I was dumped onto a team of four interns (no full time employees at all) by a somewhat neglectful manager who was promoted to a different position about two weeks in. The next supervisor who picked up our team turned out to be pretty good, but she didn't really know what to do with this strange team of incompetent interns. We worked on a few random projects, a little HTML here, a little C# there, but mostly we just sat around and talked about our favorite scenes from The Office. This was a classic paper pushing internship.

Although I truly accomplished very little, the internship turned out to be a good thing for me developmentally, because it answered a few important questions that I had about my career. I decided that I absolutely did not want to work for a traditional old-money corporation, I have zero interest in pursuing management roles, and I have an extreme aversion to meetings, bordering on a mania.

The pay was something like $5,400 a month, and they offered me a full time position at the end of the internship paying $73,000 a year. I did not take it because a) I still had two years of school left, and b) they would have had to offer me a lot more money for a job I was going to care about that little.

Qualtrics again

Coming back to Qualtrics in the fall was like a fresh of breath air. My manager had some time over the summer to plan out projects that involved me in a meaningful way, and it made all the difference in the world. I had expressed to him that I wanted more software development experience, so he suggested I work on a web application to replace an internal web form that had become highly used. I ran with it, making this the web app to end all web apps, carefully designing all of the Django modules, supporting backend services, pages with HTML, interactive functionality with vanilla JavaScript, the works. It was a lot of fun. Plus this is when my $32/hr raise kicked in.

After a few months of nose-to-the-grindstone on this one app, I started to burn out a little, and took some time to learn Vim inside and out. This was a humongous leap forward for me as a programmer who had always felt impaired by command line tools. Nowadays Vim is my primary editor for everything (including this post) and it has made a huge difference in my day-to-day satisfaction.

Because I was building this app for an infrastructure/systems team, I got to learn a bunch of stuff about Docker, Nomad, Puppet, Jenkins, Linux, and a few other devops-y things. That stuff is really not my cup of tea, but it's important to know and pretty interesting if you approach it at a high enough level.

Facebook

This was the internship I was most excited for by far. I had my eye on a big tech company ever since ExxonMobil, because I wanted to figure out if I would be happy at a massive soul-sucking corporation that happens to do ground-breaking work in an area I'm passionate about. It turns out, I am. The cushy healthcare benefits, free food, and other perks really do make a difference.

Before deciding on Facebook, I interviewed with Google and Microsoft. I had offers from Microsoft and Facebook at the same time, and Google had put me in "project matching phase" after passing the two video interviews, so I went with the safe option and chose Facebook. Amazon got back to me a couple months later and I did their online assessments just for the experience, but ended up canceling the interview because I had already made a decision.

Facebook paid me $8,000 a month, which was a lot as an intern because they also paid for my housing for the summer. I've heard that total comp for new grads is somewhere around $150k-170k if you count stocks and bonuses, but living in the Bay Area quite literally makes about half of that money disappear, after taxes and rent. So it's not terribly lucrative until you get up into the higher levels. Rumor has it that ultra-senior engineers make something like $500k-1mil and still get to primarily write code (rather than manage teams).

Overall, great experience, and I had a lot of fun working on my project. It was a network speed testing application that you could use from the browser. Wrote a ton of code in React, JavaScript (Flow), PHP (Hack), and even some C++.

This internship is still ongoing. I will come back and update with more details when it finishes.
