New Grad Job Search (WIP)
===

I recently had the pleasure and pain of making an important life decision: which company to join after graduation. I could have taken the easy way out and stayed at the company I've already been working at part-time, and actually I'm sure I would have been happy there. But for whatever reason I felt strongly that something better might be out there, so I did a broad search in my university's surrounding area and interviewed around wherever I could. This post summarizes my findings.

For the sake of this post I won't consider any intern return offers, of which I had two from both Fortune 100 and Big N. These companies are all the ones where I had to apply online and roll the dice with everyone else. Most companies had me do a technical assessment, a phone interview, and an onsite, but I'll go into more detail for each company individually.

As a disclaimer, I realize how fortunate I am to even have a choice at all, let alone multiple offers. Any of the companies I considered during this particular job search would be great employers. It's hard to go wrong with software engineering in general unless you have a terrible boss, toxic work environment, etc. and I'm relatively confident none of these places have any of that.

Companies I Applied For

With that, here's a big list of all the companies I applied for in Utah:

### Didn't get an offer

* Podium (screened out)
* Instructure (screened out)
* Ancestry (screened out)
* Hudson River Trading (rejected after a technical assessment)
* Hallo (withdrew after an interview)
* Watchtower.AI (withdrew after an interview)
* Adobe (rejected after an interview)
* WeWork (offer never materialized)

## Made me an offer

* Lucid (turned down)
* Divvy
* Qualtrics
* Plaid
* Facebook

My constraints were that any company I applied for had to be a "tech" company -- where software is their core competency -- and that it had to be close to family in a medium cost of living area: that narrows it down to the Provo-Salt Lake City area in Utah, or Austin, Texas.

Beyond these, I also wanted to work somewhere I would be compensated well, and have a career trajectory more or less in my control. I also wanted to be somewhere that would recognize my past experience and internships and not just put me in the same "track" as every other university grad.
