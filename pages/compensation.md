Compensation History
===

Programming jobs only, and only the ones I remember. There was a guy I worked for in high school for a few months but I can't remember how much he paid me ... or even what I did. Something to do with server administration. I just went over to his house a few times a month and hacked on bash scripts for the servers in his basement. I assume he paid me some amount of money but don't have a way of actually proving that.

Also including how many hours I worked and how I got the job.

1. KLAS Research

$11/hr. First testing software, then writing code for their internal web application. Worked here for about 6 months, averaging maybe 10 hours a week, off and on throughout my junior and senior year of high school. I got the gig by asking someone in my church group if he knew about any coding jobs I could get. Turns out he was the founder and CEO of his own company, and they were willing to let me hang out and work on things.

2. MJARE/UVREIA

$20/hr. Maintained a couple of Wordpress websites, also in high school. I didn't know anything about Wordpress, but they knew even less. I only worked a few hours a month when they needed something updated on the site. I found out about the opportunity because my uncle knew some people who needed a web guy. I still remember him asking me on the phone how much I "charged". Uhh ... twenty dollars an hour? I think?

3. MSE-DEV

$13/hr. This was my first on-campus job at BYU, maintaining the website for the McKay School of Education. I worked roughly 15-20 hours a week in between classes and other projects. Got the job because my older brother used to work there.

4. Upwork

$20/hr, I think? I did two Upwork projects, one with my brother and one with my friend. They were pretty basic projects, just setting up really simple Wordpress sites. I got the gigs by doing some HTML/CSS certification tests on Upwork and applying to jobs there. I think we undercut the competition on price, which in retrospect is not usually a good strategy.

5. Research assistant

$12/hr. Not much to say here. I pretended to do research for a semester while browsing Reddit and writing Clojure. Got the job by asking my professor if I could be a research assistant. Turns out the answer to that question is literally always "yes".

By this point in my career, I had developed some seriously bad work habits. At every single one of these jobs I spent at least as much time not working as actually working. I justified this by thinking that I wasn't particularly challenged, which was usually true, and by the fact that none of my bosses did anything that resembled "management", which was also true. I think people were expecting me to autonomously choose what to work on. That's a reasonable assumption for senior engineers but truly difficult for someone who sort of BSed their way into the job in the first place.

Some of these bad working habits continued for the next few jobs, but I slowly got better. I learned how to be productive at Qualtrics and later Facebook, despite still constantly feeling like wasn't someone supposed to be managing me and telling me what to work on?

Continuing...

6. Qualtrics

$28/hr, then got a raise to $32/hr after a few months. Worked about 15-20 hours a week, with one weekend where I traveled to San Jose to rack servers in a colo. This was the first job I actually got by applying on a website with a resume, and something called "interviewing". Previous interviews I had done before this point where little more than formalities. But Qualtrics actually asked me technical questions and tried to assess my programming knowledge.

7. ExxonMobil

$5,000/month. First salaried position! This was an internship where I regressed into my prior habit of squandering 80% of my time on hacker news and reddit, and by working on random JavaScript projects that caught my fancy. I got this job by applying at the BYU career fair and passing a behavioral interview, but I also had family connections to the people interviewing me so I suspect there may have been some bias.

8. Facebook

$8,000/month. Full time for a summer. Got this one in similar fashion to ExxonMobil, by applying at a career fair when some Facebook engineers set up a booth. Passed a couple of technical phone screens and got the internship.

8 jobs? wow

I guess that's a lot of jobs for someone who hasn't graduated college yet. I have always had some anxiety pushing me to get the next job, move on to the next thing, chase some new project. Hopefully my next job lasts at least a few years. I'd like to settle down a bit and invest in one company for a while.
