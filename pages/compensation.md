Compensation History
===

Programming jobs only, and only the ones I remember. There was a guy I worked for in high school for a few months but I can't remember how much he paid me ... or even what I did. Something to do with server administration. I just went over to his house a few times a month and hacked on bash scripts for the servers in his basement. I assume he paid me some amount of money but don't have a way of actually proving that.

Also including how many hours I worked and how I got the job.

1) KLAS Research

$11/hr. First testing software, then writing code for their internal web application. Worked here for about 6 months, averaging maybe 10 hours a week, off and on throughout my junior and senior year of high school. I got the gig by asking someone in my church group if he knew about any coding jobs I could get. Turns out he was the founder and CEO of his own company, and they were willing to let me hang out and work on things.

2) MJARE/UVREIA

$20/hr. Maintained a couple of Wordpress websites, also in high school. I didn't know anything about Wordpress, but they knew even less. I only worked a few hours a month when they needed something updated on the site. I found out about the opportunity because my uncle knew some people who needed a web guy. I still remember him asking me on the phone how much I "charged". Uhh ... twenty dollars an hour? I think?

3) MSE-DEV

$13/hr. This was my first on-campus job at BYU, maintaining the website for the McKay School of Education. I worked roughly 15-20 hours a week in between classes and other projects. Got the job because my older brother used to work there.

4) Upwork

$20/hr, I think? I did two Upwork projects, one with my brother and one with my friend. They were pretty basic projects, just setting up really simple Wordpress sites. I got the gigs by doing some HTML/CSS certification tests on Upwork and applying to jobs there. I think we undercut the competition on price, which in retrospect is not usually a good strategy.

5) Research assistant

$12/hr. Not much to say here. I pretended to do research for a semester while browsing Reddit and writing Clojure. Got the job by asking my professor if I could be a research assistant. Turns out the answer to that question is literally always "yes".

6) Qualtrics

$28/hr, then got a raise to $32/hr after a few months. Worked about 15-20 hours a week, with one weekend where I traveled to San Jose to rack servers in a colo. This was the first job I actually got by applying on a website with a resume, and doing something called "interviewing". Previous interviews I had done before this point where barely more than formalities. But Qualtrics actually asked me technical questions and tried to assess my programming knowledge.

7) ExxonMobil

$5,500/month. First salaried position! This was an internship where I regressed into bad habits of squandering 80% of my time on hacker news and reddit and by working on whatever random vaguely-work-related-ish side projects that caught my fancy. I got this job by applying at the BYU career fair and passing a behavioral interview, but I also had family connections to the people interviewing me so I suspect there may have been some bias.

8) Facebook

$8,000/month. Full time for a summer. Got this one in similar fashion to ExxonMobil, by applying at a career fair when some Facebook engineers set up a booth. Passed a couple of technical phone screens and got the internship.

8 jobs? wow

I guess that's a lot of jobs for someone who hasn't graduated college yet. I have always had some anxiety pushing me to get the next job, move on to the next thing, chase some new project. Hopefully my next job lasts at least a few years. I'd like to settle down a bit and invest in one company for a while.
