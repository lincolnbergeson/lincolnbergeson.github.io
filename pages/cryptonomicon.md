Cryptonomicon
===

I'm going to try something new and post a book review here. I just finished reading Neal Stephenson's most famous book Cryptonomicon. I heard about the book from Peter Thiel's book actually, Zero to One, in which he said that Cryptonomicon was "required reading" for the early employees at PayPal. I suppose that is because it is about anarchy, cryptographically secure communication, capitalism, getting rich, and it's also just a really good story. Overall it was a good book, and I would read any of Thiel's recommendations again.

This book took me a loooooong time to read. It's ~900 pages long. At 1 minute per page, which is pretty much my peak reading speed, That would be 15 hours. In reality it took me something like 30-40 hours. It's been about a year since I read the Mistborn trilogy, which was my last fiction read -- great books by the way -- and my fiction-reading chops have significantly atrophied since then. I have dabbled somewhat in non-fiction but not in the comprehensive, cover-to-cover, novel-reading sort of way. This takes a level of discipline that I have lost as an adult, and that I'm trying to regain. Reading Cryptonomicon was part of this effort to just start reading again, but in retrospect I probably should have warmed up with something a little lighter.

I found the book generally quite confusing. There are about a hundred chapters, each of which are short, fast-paced, and featuring a different web of the complex story line. Stephenson switches between anywhere from three to eight narratives at one time, spanning World War II to the present day. So there were several times where I had to stop, go re-read bits of a previous chapter, and when that failed, look stuff up online. [Steve Russillo's Cryptonomicon Page](http://russillosm.com/crypto.html) helped out A LOT here. To be fair, if I was a more experienced reader, I don't think I would have had any problems following the story lines. But being who I am it was somewhat hard.

I was 100% determined to finish the book though. The subject matter is totally my thing. I used to read a lot of fantasy but going forward I want to read more science fiction and speculative fiction. Maybe I will read some of Stephenson's other books later. As it is my book list is extremely long and I don't think I can afford to add anything to it at the moment.

Ok, now as for specific things I liked about the book. There may be light spoilers from here on out, but nothing that would ruin the book. I won't mention any sensitive details of the story line, just some isolated fragments that I enjoyed.

The main character Randy was totally relatable for me. He dates a girl (Charlene) at the beginning of the book who is steeped in academia and liberalism and relativism and a bunch of other things that I find mostly repellant. There are a few moments where Randy confronts Charlene's friends on these views and exposes their bullshit, and those were incredibly satisfying.

Randy is also the UNIX/networking nerd who knows some stuff about cryptography but isn't an expert. That's sort of how I feel. Despite the fact that they are extremely important to my day to day life, the details of crypto/security algorithms are forgettable and uninteresting to me. Stephenson does a good job of sharing just enough detail to be legitimate, but not so much that it bores you.

The book is very mathy. Alan Turing plays a prominent role as one of Randy's grandfather's friends during World War II. There are extended mathematical analogies in the book, including:

- the concept of the ocean as a Turing machine
- differential equations describing Lawrence's "horniness" plotted against his "ability to focus"

There is also a really interesting computer analogy, where Lawrence invents a primitive version of Random Access Memory while playing the organ. (The analogy is between the organ's pipes and the digital computer's vacuum tubes.)

The book introduced to me the concept of [Van Eck Phreaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Eck_phreaking), which apparently is a legitimate way for hackers to eavesdrop by picking up electromagnetic waves from a display screen? I don't know how practical it is in real life but they use it at several important points in the book.

I also just thought it was cool when the WWII and present-day storylines connected through common people, places, or events. One of the most satisfying things about reading Cryptonomicon is reading through some of the WWII stuff and thinking, "oh, that must be X from the present-day storylines" and vice versa. There were plenty of aha moments throughout.

As far as criticisms I had of the book, it was mostly the aforementioned general hard-to-follow-ness of the intertwined story lines, but I mostly fault myself for that.

The book is not a "traditional" story like Mistborn was, in that it doesn't follow a predictable format such as the [Hero's Journey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey). So there were times where I felt like, is this book actually going anywhere, or is it just sort of following the lives of these various groups of people? I didn't quite "get" the narrative flow of it. Then again, this could also be because I read the book over a roughly two and a half month time period and missed some build up.

Along those same lines, there were many individual narrative climaxes, but the general sense that it's all building to some grand confrontation is missing. Could be a good thing, because it makes the book enjoyable on its own grounds, and it's not just copying the same three story arcs invented in the Bible. But it was a little bit of an obstacle for me on occasion.

Overall I give the book, let's say, eight out of ten stars. Enjoyable, plenty of delicious moments, lots of fun analogies, a little tough to get through some parts, kind of complicated, good read for someone on a college reading level. There were plenty of vocabulary words I had to look up, which took me out of the story whenever I did, but has the positive externality that I now know a few words I didn't before.
