Why Vim
===

There are a million pages online extolling the virtues and technical abilities of the text editor Vim. I love Vim, but this post is not about its features. Ultimately, every choice is ideological, and reflects the values of the person who chose it. This post is about what factors a programmer should consider when they choose a code editor.

What Matters
---

Not everything matters. But some things matter. And the things that do, *really* matter.

For example, text doesn't matter. Editing text is not really about text. It's about communicating an idea, and when you're communicating an idea, the only thing that matters is that the idea comes through.

Think about a classical pianist playing a Beethoven sonata. It doesn't really "matter" whether they play loud or soft, fast or slow, tight or sloppy. What matters is how you feel when you listen to it. Usually that means they play minor chords to communicate sadness, or loud notes to indicate strength. But that's all theory, and the only function that theory serves is to provide guidelines for what usually works.

Thinking matters
---

The text doesn't matter. The sooner you stop thinking about text, the happier you are.

Most programming-related activities are 90% thinking, 10% doing. In practice, people spend 20-90% of their time doing because they are frustrated with their tools. That leaves less time for thinking, which is the primary activity.

Sure, you can be just as expressive in Notepad as you can in Vim. But you will notice if you spend all your time typing into Notepad that the text will begin to get in your way. You will find yourself hitting the backspace key or the arrow keys or the page-up/page-down buttons over and over, or hunting for a piece of the file by scrolling randomly with your mouse.

Vim puts text in its place by giving you the ability to make it disappear. You can jump between text objects easily and without thinking. You can manipulate massive quantities of text with sophisticated macros, regexes, and commands. You can spend your "doing" time *not thinking*, leaving more room in your brain for what matters.

Speed matters
---

Productivity is a function of speed. If you can execute on your idea faster, you will be more productive. No question.

If you type fast but you think slow, or you think fast but you have to retrace your steps because you made a mistake, or you don't make mistakes but you spend forever organizing your thoughts, you will be less productive.

There are swaths of productivity tools available to the modern programmer. None of them matter unless they increase your raw speed.

If you can write a program 2x faster in Vim than you can in a traditional IDE, you would be crazy not to use Vim. You might miss helpful IDE features like code completion and automatic refactoring. There is work being done with language servers to bring these features to Vim, but in some environments, you may be better off doing exploratory development in a traditional IDE.

But once you know what you're doing, speed is all that matters. If you know all the names of the imports that you're going to need, function signatures, and language syntax, you're better off with a tool that gets out of your way.

No other tool besides a keyboard will increase your raw speed like Vim.

First impressions don't matter
---

People say that first impressions matter. But a programmer's job is to pick the best tool for the job, and it'd be silly to pass over a powerful tool because of a poor first experience with it.

The original title of this section was "UI doesn't matter", but the user interface does matter. People complain about Vim because it's in the terminal, and it looks like its from the 80s (it is), and it has a difficult learning curve. In other words, they dislike it because it's unfamiliar and archaic.

It would silly for a carpenter to say they don't use belt sanders because they got confused by them once. But somehow that is acceptable for programmers.

Religion doesn't matter
---

Finally, considering the holy crusade that is Vim, it is important to admit that loving Vim doesn't matter. It's easy to get religious about something you love, but the moment you bring religion into a technical discussion you've lost. Religion is about making sacrifices, and when you're trying to build software, you want to make as few unnecessary sacrifices as possible.
