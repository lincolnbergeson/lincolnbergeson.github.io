Preventing the Collapse of Civilization

0:00 - 18:54: Introduction

Blow argues (along with Elon Musk) that technology's natural state is decline, not progress. Several examples of important, ground-breaking technologies from previous eras that are now lost: the Byzantine flamethrower, the Lycurgus Cup, the Pyramids. He also leans heavily on the US-Soviet space race as an example of what progress can look like - going from nothing to a man on the moon in 12 years. The point is to challenge the notion that only the late modern era is truly competent and that not all previous eras are ignorant barbarians.

It's a convincing argument but notable that of these prior inventions only the Byzantine flamethrower is genuinely lost. The rest of them we were pretty much able to figure out how they did it using modern scientific techniques. Blow cautions that those same techniques that fuel our progress today could eventually be lost, and in fact, if we aren't careful then they definitely will be lost.

"Generational transfer takes energy." True, and I notice this in my field today. Only a handful of people in the world (I estimate a few thousand?) understand how the Linux kernel works, and even fewer could implement it themselves if it were taken away. Yet we rely on Linux so heavily today. It explains why big companies that rely on it the most and that have the resources to do so (Facebook, Google) employ developers solely to work on the Linux kernel. The obvious solution to generational transfer is books, but only a fraction of human knowledge actually gets written down. Plus, a lot of books contain only time-sensitive information that would be useless to future generations, such as instruction manuals for outdated products, etc.

19:50: Blow attributes all software improvements to hardware.

21:36: Feels like he's sort of poo-pooing massive advances in machine learning as "a small piece of the program" and "really simple math". I disagree. To me (and many others) that piece of the software is total black magic.

22:15: He says that loading a bitmap onto a screen and clicking a button are massively more complex than a machine learning algorithm. By the number of jobs created by each function I think he is probably right - there are a great many more programmers who work on UI, graphics, and apps than there are programmers who work on machine learning. But I still feel like he's exaggerating to make a point here.

28:03: We are not surprised by software failing and having bugs all the time. This is actually true, once every three days or so hh_server (a language server I use for work) gets in a bad state and saving a Hack file in Vim causes the whole editor to freeze for 5 seconds. If I knew more about Vim and Vimscript in particular, I could dig in and figure out what the heck is going on, but at a surface level it's just broken. Blow walks through a million bugs in a bunch of different pieces of software. Maybe his life is worse because he uses Windows - the same stuff happens on Macs, sure, but less often in my experience. I'd be willing to be that most of these weird software bugs are due to supporting either a) legacy code, b) legacy platforms, or c) legacy behavior. Android apps are buggier than iOS apps, for example, because an Android phone can have any random piece of hardware attached to it, and iPhones are more or less homogenous. So our standards lowering is at least partly a function of our platforms broadening.

29:00: We don't use "five 9s" anymore as a metric for reliability. That's not true, many places still do this. AWS S3 claims [11 9's of reliability](https://blog.cloudsecurityalliance.org/2010/05/24/amazon-aws-11-9s-of-reliability/). I tried to find others but actually Google and Netflix are [not as optimistic](https://greenm3.typepad.com/green_m3_blog/2011/01/google-amazon-and-netflix-comment-on-uptime-99999.html) about their reliability numbers. Interesting, he may have a point here.
