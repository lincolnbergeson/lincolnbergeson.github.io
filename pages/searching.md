Searching Versus Executing
===

For the past few months I have been percolating in my mind the concepts of "searching" and "executing" as they relate to a typical software engineer's daily work.

The way I see it, if you are not either searching or executing, you're not working.

And that's fine! There needs to be time you spend at work not actually working -- you have to eat lunch, socialize with your coworkers, take breaks every now and then, and all that good stuff.

But I consider the work that most programmers do on a daily basis, by definition, to be either searching a problem space or executing an idea.

Searching is all the time you spend:
- Browsing documentation
- Exploring system designs and architecture
- Reading industry news
- Reading code
- Reviewing other people's code
- Watching technical videos
- Reading email from coworkers
- Chatting either IRL or online about work-related topics
- Considering new ways to approach a problem
- Monitoring production systems
- Making decisions
- Debugging code

And a million other things. You can pretty much add anything to this list that doesn't involve typing. There are ways of searching that do involve typing (such as literally searching, with a search engine), but anything that doesn't directly involve typing definitely falls in the "searching" category.

Note that this rule only applies to programming work -- managers, for example, do most of their work by persuading, explaining, teaching, mentoring, planning, etc. At a lot of companies, tech leads and even senior engineers will do this work as well. And it's valuable work! But for our purposes, consider "searching" to be anything that looks to other people like "not actually working".

For most people, searching is the boring part of the job. It's banging your head against the wall when you can't figure something out, it's reading about how some other company approached some new problem, it's stepping through code, it's staring at dashboards and trying to figure out what the heck is going on.

But some people love searching. And those people go on to become technical program managers, architects, systems designers, and more.

Generally, the more people get promoted, the more time they spend on searching. Often the executing parts are delegated to new grads and other lower level software engineers.
