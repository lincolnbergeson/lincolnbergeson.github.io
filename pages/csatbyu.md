Computer Science at BYU
===

Since I'm getting close to finishing my CS degree at BYU, I'm doing a write-up of all the CS classes I've taken and what I enjoyed about them.

Overall, getting the degree has been worth it, but as you'll see in this post, my attitude towards my college education is ambivalent at best.

Freshman year
===

142, 224, 235, 236

Intro to Computer Programming was kind of a waste of time, but tolerable because I took it online. I heard there was a way to challenge the course, and I had a decent amount of programming experience in high school, but after a two year break from coding during my mission, I didn't feel confident that I could do it without significant preparation. The class was through a site called "ZYBooks" and didn't take up too much out of my life, except for when I had to chase down annoying C++ syntax errors. 5/10.

Computer Systems had the potential to be an interesting class. They changed the course material significantly the year after I took it, and maybe it's better now, but at the time everything was presented in such an ad-hoc and confusing way. That said, there were a few interesting things that we learned, like numerical representation (two's complement, IEEE floating point), context switching, multiplexing, handful of other concepts. Lot of people hated this class because the teacher sort of just expected you to pick things up without walking you through them very much. 6/10.

Data Structures was okay, not amazing. The teacher was really laid back and let us work on labs during class, but that also meant that most days it felt like going to class was pointless. He also walked us through every algorithm so we really didn't have to think that hard or figure things out. This class was all in C++ just like 142, so that meant more fighting the language to get it to do what you wanted. That was unpleasant, but it was pretty interesting to learn about AVL trees, pathfinding, and sorting algorithms. 6.5/10. 

Discrete Structures was a weird class. The first few weeks are all discrete math and set theory, and then all of a sudden they plunge you into the nuts and bolts of building a Datalog interpreter, which is the main project throughout the duration of the class. Learning about parsing and lexing, context free grammars, LL1 recursive descent was all really cool, easily the most interesting thing I learned that year. But the details of implementing the interpreter in, you guessed it, C++, frequently got in the way and annoyed the crap out of me. My teacher was also a fast-talker so you really had to strain to follow along during class. 6.5/10.

Sophomore year

240, 252, 324, 330, 405

Advanced Programming Concepts was alright. Apparently it's one of those classes that used to be hard, but they relaxed the course material significantly since people weren't able to finish all the projects. Or so I'm told. I enjoyed some of the lecture material but writing a Java server and an Android app were also not very fun. Up to this point in my education we had only used programming languages thst somehow managed to be right in the intersection of "boring to use" and "hard to learn". 5/10.

Intro to Computational Theory tricked me by starting out as a boring class, where we just repeated stuff from 236 (finite state machines, context free grammars) but then suddenly became incredibly interesting when we switched to turing machines, which was the focus of the second half of the semester. We wrote algorithms in plain English, which was surprisingly enjoyable, and I got to wrap my mind around proofs of the halting problem, 3-sat, and other classic computer science topics like P = NP, NP hard, and Big O. 7.5/10.

Systems Programming was like 142, 235, and 236 in that the language was annoying and difficult (C), but the class was actually really great because we dove into the guts of sockets, file descriptors, DNS, threads vs processes, and HTTP proxy servers. An unexpected collection of topics. Also, my Facebook interview pretty much consisted only of material I learned in this class. If I hadn't learned the material there is no possible way I could've gotten my internship there. I wish I could give this class a higher rating, but the professor absolutely infuriated me during lectures by interrupting his instruction (LITERALLY) every thirty seconds because someone raised their hand. 7/10.

Concepts of Programming Languages I took because I heard it was a super easy, and I was not disappointed. Absolute breeze of a class. We were exposed to some interesting ideas too -- it was basically, every couple of weeks we learned how to write a trivial program in a new weird programming language. Started out with Racket, then a Lisp interpreter in Julia, a sudoku solver in Haskell (hard to figure out but absolutely beautiful in hindsight), supervision trees in Erlang, and logic puzzles in Prolog. There might have been another language or two in there that I forgot about. 8/10.

Creating a Software Business was also a fun class. The professor is the retired Founder/CEO of LifeLink, some company that sold software to life insurance salesmen. Now he is an investor who exclusively invests in B2B SaaS companies in Utah Valley. This class was also a breeze. Very little programming involved -- we spent the lectures learning about customer acquisition costs, lifetime value, lean startup, business model canvas, and other businessy things. Only project during the semester is an easy 20-hour project that you do with a partner. 8/10.

Junior year

312, 355, 465, 340, 401R, 462

Algorithm Design and Analysis was like a way harder version of 235. The class was structured really well, with a few projects where you would learn some new technique or strategy for solving hard algorithm problems. I can't remember the order, but we did projects in dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, tree traversal, and a bunch of other stuff. I should probably revisit this material before my next technical interview. Solid class, not exactly "fun" but interesting stuff to learn about nonetheless. 7/10.

Intro to Graphics and Image Processing I expected to be a fun and easy class, but it turned out to be both incredibly boring and annoyingly hard. It turns out I just really do not care about graphics and image processing. I enjoyed making games in high school on my calculator, but the advanced stuff is just way beyond me, and I really don't have an intuition for it. If I could go back and un-take this class, I would. 3/10.

Computer Security was another one that just frustrated me. I liked the class structure, because the professor was extremely lenient, and also because he put the hardest project first. Implementing AES was suprisingly fun but it was all downhill from there. Cryptography is *way* too math heavy for my liking. It's also just extremely confusing to keep track of the differences between PGP and GPG, and all the million reasons secure email hasn't caught on, and all the different ways you can implement HMACs and what the security ramifications. Turns out I'm not a "security guy" either. I'm actually glad I took the class, because I learned some security fundamentals that are genuinely useful, but man was it not a fun class. 4/10.

Software Design and Testing was also just kind of meh. It was basically 240 but with a group. Luckily we got to choose what technology we got to use, so my group chose React and Typescript (hooray for no Android!) but learning about design patterns is really not revolutionary anymore. I learned a few important things about dependency injection, the single responsibility principle, and some other patterns, but it's all stuff I would have vastly preferred to just learn on the job. Plus group projects are never fun. 4.5/10.

Blockchain Technologies sounded interesting but fell short of my expectations. It was interesting to learn all the technical details of mining, proof of work, Bitcoin, and a few general distributed systems design problems, but the class was not very well structured. It was sort of a "choose your own adventure" thing and I don't really enjoy that in a classroom setting. There were a million tiny frustrations that I won't go into here. Suffice it to say I hope this class doesn't become part of the regular CS curriculum. 3.5/10.

Distributed Systems Design really had the potential to be an amazing class, but the teacher insisted on using this strange actor language called KRL that he had invented in a previous job. As all toy languages are, it was horribly documented, weirdly idiomatic, and difficult to use. This class could have been amazing if the teacher actually had us do relevant projects, like spinning up a database quorum in Galera, or load-testing an NGINX load-balancer, or a million other actually useful things. Instead we got to play pretend in a little sandbox and learn "principles". At least the class was online so I didn't have to sit through lectures. 4/10.
