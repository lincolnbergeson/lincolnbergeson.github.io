As an impressionable young coder, I used to love reading through programming blogs. Coding Horror, Joel on Software, JWZ, Steve Yegge's Blog Rants -- always something new to learn, some new opinion to hear. I would read through the archives and dive deep on whatever I found interesting at the time.

In the era of content marketing and email newsletters, blogs that are written solely for the joy of programming are harder to find. I want to recapture that feeling I had in the beginning, of discovering like minds across the internet.

I have set up this site with a documentation theme. Some blogs exist to develop a readership, cultivate a following, funnel leads through a content marketing pipeline, build an email newsletter, etc etc etc. I am not interested in any of that. This site is a reference point for my thinking on a variety of programming related topics, and nothing more.

My formative moments in tech were shaped by reading indutry veterans' opinions online. While I could not be considered a "veteran" without a significant stretch of the imagination, I have things to say about programming, and this is me saying them. Enjoy :)
